# ReactJS Macro Calculator

This is a Food Tracking Application that was built with Reactjs. The user inputs their weight and then choses one of 3 goals, cut, maintain, or bulk. Upon user click of goal, the app will show the amount of each macronutrient, carb, protein, and fat that is needed for the day in order to reach their goal.

The next section of the application allows the user to track the foods they have eaten for the day and then display the remaining amount of calories and macros needed until they reach their goal for the day. If the user goes over their goal for a certain macro, the user will be displayed a red negative remaining balance for the macro.
