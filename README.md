# Macro Meals â€“ React Macro Calculator

This application is intended to give the user a target goal of calories and macros, based on the user's goal. The user may choose up to one of three options, to cut, maintain or shred weight. 

Once a weight is entered and a goal is chosen, the user may log food items they have consumed for the day with the corresponding macros. 

The remainding amount of carbs, protein, and fats will be adjusted per user addition of foods logged for the day, and user deletion of an item if needed.
